She opened the dusty journal, its worn pages crackling softly. Each entry was a doorway to a younger self filled with dreams, heartbreaks, and laughter. As she read, time seemed to fold inward. Though years had passed, the voice on those pages still felt familiar, raw, and true like rediscovering a forgotten piece of her own soul.
The train station buzzed with life luggage clattered, announcements echoed, strangers brushed shoulders. Amid the chaos, he waited quietly, bouquet in hand, eyes scanning every face. Time slowed with each passing second. And then, there she was smiling, eyes glistening, steps quickening. In that instant, the world blurred, and only they remained, finally closing the distance of years.
Each night, he climbed to the rooftop to watch the stars awaken. City lights below, the universe above a contrast he cherished. Beneath constellations, he made promises only the stars could hear.

The mountains stood watch, eternal and quiet, as if guarding a secret that only those who truly listened could ever understand.
